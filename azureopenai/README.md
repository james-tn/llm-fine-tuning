# Fine-Tuning OpenAI Models: Best Practices and Examples  
  
This section of the repository provides **best practices and hands-on examples** for fine-tuning OpenAI models to handle various specialized tasks. Leveraging OpenAI's powerful APIs, the examples here demonstrate how to adapt pre-trained models to specific use cases and scenarios. The goal is to help users optimize the performance of OpenAI models for tasks such as function calling, Python code generation, SQL code generation, and emerging techniques like **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** and **vision-based tasks**.  
  
## Overview of Contents  
  
### 1. [Function Calling](function_calling)  
This example demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAI models for **function calling** tasks, enabling the model to output structured results in formats like JSON. This is particularly useful for scenarios where the model needs to interact with APIs, generate function signatures, or provide machine-readable outputs.  
  
### 2. [Python Code Generation](python_analytic)  
The **Python Code Generation** example focuses on fine-tuning models to generate Python scripts or snippets based on natural language inputs. This is ideal for tasks like automating repetitive coding workflows, generating analytics scripts, or assisting developers with code suggestions.  
  
### 3. [SQL Code Generation](sql_gen)  
This example showcases fine-tuning OpenAI models for **SQL code generation**, enabling the model to translate natural language queries into SQL statements. This is particularly useful for building tools that allow non-technical users to interact with databases.  
  
### 4. Future Additions  
- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: Fine-tuning models using user preference data to align outputs better with human expectations.  
- **Vision Tasks**: Exploring fine-tuning methods for OpenAI models that incorporate vision capabilities, enabling multi-modal functionality.

## Getting Started  
  
### Prerequisites  
1. **OpenAI API Key**: Ensure you have access to OpenAI's API. You can obtain an API key by signing up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/).  
2. **Python Environment**: Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. Use the `requirements.txt` file in each subdirectory to install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  

### Running Examples  
Each subdirectory contains a specific example for fine-tuning OpenAI models. Follow the instructions in the respective folders to run the examples.  
  
#### Example: Running Function Calling Fine-Tuning  
1. Navigate to the `function_calling` directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd function_calling  
2. Prepare your dataset and configure the settings in the provided script.
3. Run the fine-tuning example

## Notes  
- This section will be updated with new examples and techniques as they become available. Stay tuned for the addition of **DPO** and **vision-based fine-tuning**.  
- Ensure that your dataset complies with OpenAI's [data preparation guidelines](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/data-preparation).
