### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL retrieves total sales and the number of distinct orders for Q1 2023 using a `JOIN` on the `OrderDetails` and `orders` tables.
2. **DataFrame Handling**: It calculates the average order value by dividing total sales by the number of distinct orders.
3. **Display**: The result is wrapped in a DataFrame for consistency with the display function.","The provided code correctly duplicates the logic from the reference implementation with slight differences in variables and formatting. Both implementations perform the same SQL query to calculate total sales and order count for Q1 2023. The average order value is then computed by dividing total sales by order count. Finally, the results are displayed in a similar manner. Therefore, the provided code answers the business analytics request accurately and reflects the logic of the reference code.",both

data = execute_sql_query(sql_query)

```","The input code fetches the 10 products with the lowest units in stock that are not discontinued, whereas the reference implementation fetches just one product regardless of its discontinued status. This difference in logic and number of results makes the input code incorrect against the given request.","Below is the Python code that retrieves the products with the lowest units in stock.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The query calculates the percentage of late shipments by dividing the count of late shipments by the total number of orders, grouped by the order month.

2. **Query Execution**: The utility function `execute_sql_query` is called with the SQL query string to retrieve the necessary data.

3. **Data Preparation**: The `OrderMonth` column is converted to a datetime type and sorted to ensure proper ordering of the bar chart.

4. **Visualization**: A bar chart is created using Plotly's `px.bar()` function to visualize the monthly on-time delivery rates.

5. **Display**: Finally, the created bar chart is displayed to the user using `show_to_user`.

Remember to ensure that the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `plotly`) are installed in your Python environment before running this code.","The input code calculates 'OnTimeDeliveryRate', which is incorrect as it should be 'LateDeliveryRate'. Moreover, it misinterprets 'OnTimeDeliveryRate' as percentage of late deliveries, resulting in a mislabeling in both the calculation and the visualization label. Additionally, it uses 'CAST(OrderDate AS DATE)' instead of 'DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m')', which does not accurately group the orders by month. These differences lead to a misalignment with the intended business analytics request and reference implementation.",Base

### Code Explanation:
- We define the SQL query that retrieves the average monthly sales for each region.
- We use the `execute_sql_query` function to run the SQL query and get a DataFrame `df`.
- We then create a multi-line chart using the plotly library's `px.line()` function, specifying the x-axis and y-axis data along with color differentiation by region.
- Finally, we display the resulting figure using `show_to_user(fig)`, which is assumed to be a utility function provided within the analysis environment.","The input code calculates average monthly sales for the year 2023 only, whereas the reference code calculates based on distinct months present in the entire dataset without filtering by year.

2. **Pivoting Data**: We pivot the resulting DataFrame to get a format suitable for a stacked bar chart, with months as index and Employee IDs as columns.
3. **Visualization**: We utilize Plotly's `px.bar()` to create a stacked bar chart to visualize the data.
4. **Display**: Finally, the stacked bar chart is displayed using the provided utility function. 

Always ensure that the columns in the DataFrame used in `px.bar` align with the expected structure for visualizations.","The input code pivots the DataFrame which is not necessary since Plotly can directly use the DataFrame without pivoting if structured correctly. The `px.bar()` function is correctly called but the use of `pivot_df.columns` and `pivot_df.index` in the chart can lead to errors as `px.bar()` expects column names for the y-axis values, not the actual columns array. The reference implementation directly uses the DataFrame output from SQL without pivoting, making it a more straightforward and correct approach.",Base

Although the input uses an additional 'color_continuous_scale', this does not affect the correctness related to the business request and visualization goals.","To compare the total number of units sold between discontinued and active products and visualize the result with a comparative bar chart, we can use the following approach:

1. Query the data to get the total units sold for active and discontinued products.
2. Construct a pandas DataFrame to format the data correctly.
3. Use matplotlib to create a bar chart for visualization.

Here's the Python code that accomplishes this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# SQL queries to get the total units sold
sql_query_active = """"""
SELECT SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalActiveUnits
FROM [Order Details] od

discontinued_units_df = execute_sql_query(sql_query_discontinued)

# Create a dataframe for visualization
comparison_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Status': ['Active', 'Discontinued'],
    'Units Sold': [active_units_df['TotalActiveUnits'][0], discontinued_units_df['TotalDiscontinuedUnits'][0]]
})

# Create a bar chart for comparison
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.bar(comparison_df['Status'], comparison_df['Units Sold'], color=['blue', 'red'])
plt.title('Total Units Sold: Active vs Discontinued Products')
plt.ylabel('Units Sold')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Queries**: Two SQL queries are executed to retrieve total units sold for active and discontinued products using the `SUM` function with a join.
2. **DataFrame Creation**: A new DataFrame `comparison_df` is created to hold the data for visualization.
3. **Bar Chart**: A bar chart is created using `matplotlib` to compare the units sold for active and discontinued products.

This code assumes you have a function `execute_sql_query` defined to execute SQL queries and fetch results as pandas DataFrames. It also requires pandas and matplotlib libraries to be installed and imported.","The provided code correctly addresses the business analytics request by comparing the total units sold between discontinued and active products. It adheres to the same logic as the reference implementation by summing the quantity of products according to their discontinued status, but it executes two separate queries instead of a grouped query. It then visualizes the result with a bar chart using matplotlib, which is an acceptable alternative to Plotly used in the reference. Both approaches achieve the same analytical goal.",both

It also misalignment occurs because it is comparing sales from different years, whereas the task specifies a month-to-month comparison within the same year.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query retrieves the `CategoryID`, `CategoryName`, and the average `UnitPrice` from the `products` table joined with the `categories` table.
  
2. **Data Retrieval**: The `execute_sql_query` function executes the SQL query to get the data in a pandas DataFrame.

3. **Visualization**: A bar chart is created using Plotly with categories on the x-axis and average unit price on the y-axis.

4. **Display Result**: The visualization is displayed to the user with the `show_to_user` function. 

Make sure the `execute_sql_query` and `show_to_user` functions are properly defined in your environment to handle SQL execution and displaying results respectively.","The provided code correctly answers the business analytics request and follows the same logic as the reference implementation with a minor enhancement: it includes both CategoryID and CategoryName, which can provide more clarity in the visualization. The SQL query accurately aggregates the average unit price by category, and the visualization uses these aggregated results to display a bar chart of average unit price by category. The join with the categories table ensures the inclusion of CategoryName, which enhances the interpretability of the x-axis labels in the plot. The key processes—data retrieval, aggregation, and visualization—follow the logical flow of the reference implementation.",both

The relevant SQL query would ensure the dates fall within the specified range.

Here's how we can implement this using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# SQL query to fetch OrderDate and ShippedDate for orders in March 2023

SELECT OrderDate, ShippedDate 
FROM orders

avg_fulfillment_time = df['FulfillmentTime'].mean()

# Display the result
show_to_user(pd.DataFrame({'AvgOrderFulfillmentTime': [avg_fulfillment_time]}))
```

### Explanation:
1. We use the SQL query to retrieve the `OrderDate` and `ShippedDate` for orders from March 2023, ensuring only these orders are selected.
2. We calculate the order fulfillment time in days by converting the date strings to datetime objects and taking their difference.
3. The average of the fulfillment times is computed and displayed to the user using the `show_to_user` function.","The input Python code correctly retrieves orders from March 2023 and calculates the average order fulfillment time. The SQL query accurately filters the orders using `DATE_FORMAT` to check the month and year, aligning with the reference implementation's `BETWEEN` clause on dates. The calculation of fulfillment time aligns logically with the reference code, computing the difference in days between `ShippedDate` and `OrderDate` and taking the mean. Furthermore, the result is displayed similarly with only a naming difference in output columns, which does not affect the correctness.",both

### Key Components Explained:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query retrieves the monthly inventory turnover ratio by grouping data by month.
2. **Data Handling**: The `Month` column is converted to a datetime format to ensure correct chronological visualization.
3. **Visualization**: A line chart is created using Plotly to show the turnover ratio over time, which allows for a clear view of changes across the months.
4. **Display**: The visualization is then displayed to the user.

This approach ensures that the analysis is both accurate and visually intuitive for the user to interpret the changes in the inventory turnover ratio.","The input code changes the aggregation from 'DATEPART(month, OrderDate)' to 'strftime('%Y-%m', OrderDate)' and uses '%Y-%m' which groups by year and month, while the reference implementation groups only by month.

- The `execute_sql_query` function runs the SQL query and retrieves the data into a pandas DataFrame.
- We then compute the average order value by dividing the total sales by the number of unique orders.
- Finally, the result is shown to the user in a DataFrame specifically focused on the average order value.","The provided code correctly calculates the average order value for June 2023 by summing the total sales and dividing by the count of distinct orders, precisely following the logic of the reference implementation.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The provided SQL query retrieves the required data by counting `OrderID` for each combination of month and `ShipVia`.
  
2. **DataFrame Manipulation**: The 'Month' column is converted to a datetime type for correct plotting order.

3. **Plotting**: A line plot is created using `plotly.express` with 'Month' on the x-axis, 'OrderCount' on the y-axis, and colors representing different shipping methods.

4. **Display**: The plot is displayed using `show_to_user` which is assumed to be a provided utility function.

Make sure to execute the code within an environment where the required libraries are installed, and `execute_sql_query` and `show_to_user` functions are defined.","Both the reference and input codes achieve the same goal of counting the total number of orders by month and shipping method. The input code converts the 'Month' column to a datetime format which is more robust for plotting, while the reference code pivots the data. Both approaches will produce similar line plots using Plotly Express, showing the trend of orders shipped via each method per month. The labels and titles in both visualizations correctly represent the axes and data, and both codes use 'show_to_user()' to display the plot.",Finetuned

### Explanation:

   - Another for retrieving unique customers in the prior 6 months.
2. **Data Execution**: The SQL queries are executed to get two DataFrame objects.
3. **Retention Rate Calculation**: The retention rate is calculated as the ratio of the current customers to prior customers.
4. **Data Handling**: In case of zero preceding customers, it avoids division by zero.
5. **Display Result**: The calculated retention rate is displayed to the user.","The input code correctly calculates the Customer Retention Rate for the last 6 months by dividing the number of unique customers in the last 6 months by the number in the prior 6 months, similar to the reference code.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query:** We construct an SQL query that retrieves the total sales revenue by month for the year 2022.
2. **Data Retrieval:** Use the utility function `execute_sql_query` to execute the SQL query and get the resulting data into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **Data Preparation:** We ensure that the `Month` column is in string format and zero-padded for correct chronological ordering.
4. **Visualization:** Use Plotly's `px.line()` function to create a line chart for the monthly sales trends.
5. **Display Result:** Finally, we invoke the `show_to_user` function to present the chart to the user.","The provided input code achieves the intended goal of calculating total sales revenue per month for the year 2022 and visualizes it as a time series chart. The SQL query correctly selects the year and month from the 'OrderDate', computes 'TotalSales', and groups by year and month, which aligns with the reference implementation's logic. The data preparation steps and visualization using Plotly also match the intended process, ensuring months are presented in chronological order. While the input code formats months differently and includes markers, these differences do not impact achieving the core request.",both

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **SQL Query**: The query retrieves the OrderID and calculates the total value of each order based on the order details, filtering orders by the specified date range.
2. **Execution**: The SQL query is executed using the provided utility function `execute_sql_query`.
3. **Aggregate Calculations**:
   - The total sales value is calculated using `.sum()`.
   - The count of unique orders is computed using `.nunique()`.
4. **Average Order Value Computation**: The average is calculated by dividing the total sales value by the number of unique orders.
5. **Display**: The result, wrapped in a DataFrame, is displayed using `show_to_user`.

This will yield the expected average order value for the specified period.","The input code does not account for the discount on orders, while the reference implementation calculates order values with discounts in mind. Therefore, the input code doesn't match the business logic of the reference implementation, which appropriately considers discounts when calculating the average order value.",None

highest_city = execute_sql_query(sql_query)

It queries the number of orders for each city, groups by city, orders by the count in descending order, and limits the result to 1, which matches the logic of the reference implementation. Both provide the city with the highest number of orders.","To determine which city has received the highest number of orders, we can query the data warehouse and retrieve this information. Here's how you can write the Python code to achieve this:

The result is displayed to the user. Note that I used `LIMIT 1` to ensure we only get the top result.","The input Python code correctly replicates the logic of the reference implementation. Both codes construct and execute an SQL query that selects the ShipCity and counts the OrderID entries, groups the results by ShipCity, orders them by the count in descending order, and limits the result to the top entry only.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: Retrieves average order fulfillment time per region for the last month.
2. **Data Processing**: The dataframe is prepared with structured columns for region and average fulfillment time.
3. **Heat Map Visualization**:
   - Uses Plotly's `density_mapbox` for geographic data visualization.
   - `lat` and `lon` parameters need valid coordinates; you might need a mapping of regions to their coordinates, which is not included in the SQL data. Please adjust for actual latitude and longitude values.
4. **Displaying the Data**: The resulting visualization and the region with the highest fulfillment time are displayed using `show_to_user` function. 
5. Ensure the correct handling of geographic coordinates to display the heat map accurately.

### Note:
If the average fulfillment time is not geographic data, the heat map visualization might be unnecessary unless further adapted to visualize non-geographic categorical data. Adjust accordingly as per the actual data structure.","The provided code deviates from the reference implementation in several key areas: 1) The SQL query unnecessarily joins the 'customers' table and selects regions from there instead of directly from 'orders', assuming 'ShipRegion' exists. 2) The reference implementation uses a heatmap to compare non-geographic order fulfillment times by region, whereas the input code uses a density mapbox which implies geographic mapping that is not justified by the available data. 3) Latitude and longitude are used without them being part of the dataset, leading to potential errors.

```python
import plotly.express as px

# SQL query to retrieve data

### Breakdown of the code:
1. **SQL Execution**: A SQL query retrieves the total quantity sold per product category by joining the `products` and `Order Details` tables.
2. **Data Processing**: The result is assumed to be a DataFrame with columns `CategoryID` and `TotalQuantity`.
3. **Visualization**: Plotly's `px.pie` function is used to create a pie chart.
4. **Display Result**: The generated pie chart is displayed using `show_to_user`.

This Python code snippet should work seamlessly with the functions provided by your environment to display the data to the user.","The input Python code accurately executes the business analytics request by querying the database to calculate the total quantity of products sold per product category. It joins the 'products' table with 'Order Details' table similar to the reference code and uses a GROUP BY clause to sum the quantities per CategoryID.

It uses an SQL query to calculate and return the top five cities with the highest total sales, similar to the reference implementation.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: This retrieves the month and count of orders for the current year, grouping by month.
2. **Data Sorting**: To ensure that the months are plotted correctly on the x-axis, we sort the DataFrame by `OrderMonth`.
3. **Plotting**: Using Plotly's `px.line`, we create a line chart that displays the trend with clear labeling and a title.
4. **Displaying the Chart**: The final plot is presented to the user using the provided utility function. 

This code snippet will generate the line chart based on the SQL query results and show the monthly trend of order placements to the user.","The input code correctly implements the business analytics request using a similar logic to the reference. Both scripts perform a SQL query to retrieve the monthly order data for the current year, sort the DataFrame, and use Plotly to create a line chart. The primary difference is in variable naming and slight variations in labeling, which do not affect the correctness of the implementation.",both

show_to_user(employees_df[['EmployeeID', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Tenure (Years)']])
```","The input code calculates employee tenure in years, while the reference implementation calculates the duration in days. The business request was to determine how long each employee has been working, aligning with the reference implementation's measure in days, not years. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy in the columns shown to the user: the reference only includes 'EmployeeID' and duration, whereas the input includes additional columns.","To calculate how long each employee has been working at the company, we can use the current date and the `HireDate` from the employees table. We can leverage the difference in years to determine the tenure.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# SQL query to fetch employee data
sql_query = ""SELECT EmployeeID, HireDate FROM employees;""

# Execute SQL query
employees_df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)

# Show the result to the user
show_to_user(employees_df[['EmployeeID', 'TenureYears']])
```

This code fetches the employee data, calculates the tenure for each employee, and displays only the `EmployeeID` and `TenureYears`.","The provided code calculates employee tenure in years, but the reference implementation requests the result in days. Therefore, even though the logic is similar in terms of calculating difference from the hire date to the current date, the provided implementation does not adhere to the same logic regarding the unit of time (years instead of days).",None

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query Execution**: The provided SQL query fetches hire dates and performance ratings of employees, ensuring only non-null performance ratings are included.
2. **Data Handling**: The hire dates are converted to a datetime format for proper representation in the scatter plot.
3. **Visualization**: A scatter plot is generated using `plotly.express`, mapping hire dates to performance ratings.
4. **Display**: The resulting plot is displayed to the user.

### Note:
This approach assumes `PerformanceRating` is a numeric representation for correlation analysis. Adjustments may be necessary depending on how ratings are stored (like as categorical or different scale).","The input code differs from the reference implementation significantly. It uses `PerformanceRating` instead of `TotalSales` to measure performance. The logic for calculating performance as a standardized metric based on `TotalSales` is missing in the input code.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **SQL Query Execution**: Execute a SQL query to retrieve the average fulfillment time by month. Here, `ORDERS` is assumed to be the table containing relevant order details.

3. **DataFrame Manipulation**: Convert the 'Month' column to a datetime object for proper ordering when plotting.

4. **Sorting**: Sort the DataFrame by 'Month' to ensure the line chart reflects the correct chronological order.

5. **Plotting**: Use Plotly's `px.line()` function to create a line chart of average fulfillment time by month.

6. **Display**: Use `show_to_user` function to display the resulting visualization.","The input code groups orders by '%Y-%m' instead of by month only, which differs from the reference logic.

### Explanation:

1. **SQL Query**: A SQL query retrieves the `ShipRegion` and calculates the `OnTimeDeliveryRate`. The counting in the SQL query handles potential division by zero by ensuring there are orders in count using `COUNT(OrderID)`.

2. **Data Execution**: The query is executed using `execute_sql_query()` to retrieve the relevant data as a DataFrame.

3. **Data Sorting**: The DataFrame is sorted in descending order based on `OnTimeDeliveryRate` to highlight the best-performing regions at the top.

4. **Visualization**: A bar chart is created using `plotly.express`, which is user-friendly and visually appealing.

5. **Display**: Finally, the visualization is displayed to the user using `show_to_user()`.

1. Query the necessary data from the `orders` table.
2. Calculate the difference between the `RequiredDate` and `OrderDate` for each order.
3. Compute the average of these differences.

Below is the Python code that implements these steps:

1. **SQL Query**: We are selecting `OrderDate` and `RequiredDate` from the `orders` table.
2. **DataFrame Processing**:
   - Both `OrderDate` and `RequiredDate` are converted to datetime format.
   - The difference in days is computed using vectorized operations, and we take the mean of the resulting series to get the average number of days.
3. **Display**: The result is displayed using the provided utility function `show_to_user`.

Here's the Python code that accomplishes this:

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query:** We execute a SQL query that counts on-time shipments for each employee and groups by `EmployeeID`.
2. **Data Filtering:** After executing the SQL query, we find the maximum number of on-time orders and filter the dataframe to keep only the employee(s) with that count.
3. **Visualization:** A bar chart is created using Plotly to display the data and is shown to the user.

Make sure the `execute_sql_query` and `show_to_user` functions are properly defined in your environment to execute this code successfully.","The input Python code differs from the reference implementation in its logic. The reference code plots a bar chart for all employees and their on-time orders, while the input code filters to show only the employee(s) with the most on-time orders. This results in different outcomes for the graph, as the input code visualizes only the top employee(s), not all employees like the reference code.",Base

### Explanation:
- The code executes a SQL query to retrieve the on-time delivery rates for all shipping companies.
- It sorts the result in descending order to easily identify the company with the highest rate.
- The visualization uses plotly's express module to create a bar chart.
- Finally, it displays both the chart and the data for the company with the highest rate to the user.","The input code does not fully match the reference implementation logic. It calculates on-time delivery using 'COUNT(CASE WHEN ...)', which may introduce NULLs if the CASE fails and thus give incorrect rates. It sorts the dataframe separately rather than using SQL ORDER BY, which affects large datasets performance. Additionally, it displays the company with the highest rate after plotting, which isn't required by the analytics request. The reference solution's SQL query correctly calculates on-time delivery by multiplying the conditional sum by 1.0 (ensuring float division) and orders the result in SQL, adhering directly to the analytics request’s demand.",Base

# Display the visualization to the user
show_to_user(fig)
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: We construct an SQL query to fetch the top 5 products based on total sales revenue.
2. **Execute SQL Query**: The `execute_sql_query(sql_query)` function retrieves the data and saves it into a pandas DataFrame called `top_products_df`.
3. **Visualization**: We use Plotly to create a bar chart comparing the sales revenue among the top 5 products.
4. **Display**: Finally, we display the visualization to the user using `show_to_user(fig)`. 

Make sure to adjust the table and column names in the SQL query if they differ in your database schema.","The evaluated code does not include the discount calculation in the total revenue, which is a critical part of the logic in the reference implementation. The discount is included in the reference SQL query as part of the revenue calculation: `(1 - [Order Details].Discount)`. Without this, the evaluated code does not adhere to the same business logic for determining total sales revenue.",Base

```","The input code does not filter the dataframe to show only the products with the highest and lowest inventory turnover ratios in the visualization. It plots all inventory turnover ratios instead. Although it calculates the highest and lowest turnover ratios, these are not used to filter or create a separate visualization comparable to the reference code. Additionally, the input code provides a separate output of the highest and lowest turnover values, but that isn't visualized specifically as required.","To identify which products have the highest and lowest inventory turnover ratio, we will calculate the turnover ratio for each product using sales data and inventory levels. The inventory turnover ratio is typically calculated as:

\[
\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
\]

For this exercise, we will use the data available in the MDDX data warehouse, specifically from the `Products` and `Order Details` tables.

Here's how we can implement the solution using Python:

```python
import plotly.express as px

# SQL queries to calculate COGS and average inventory
sql_query_cogs = """"""
SELECT p.ProductID, SUM(od.UnitPrice * od.Quantity * (1 - od.Discount)) AS COGS 
FROM products p

GROUP BY p.ProductID;
""""""

sql_query_avg_inventory = """"""
SELECT p.ProductID, AVG(p.UnitsInStock) AS AvgInventory 
FROM products p 
GROUP BY p.ProductID;
""""""

# Execute the SQL queries
cogs_df = execute_sql_query(sql_query_cogs)
avg_inventory_df = execute_sql_query(sql_query_avg_inventory)

# Merge the two dataframes on ProductID
merged_df = cogs_df.merge(avg_inventory_df, on='ProductID')

# Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio
merged_df['InventoryTurnover'] = merged_df['COGS'] / merged_df['AvgInventory']

# Identify products with the highest and lowest turnover ratios
highest_turnover = merged_df.loc[merged_df['InventoryTurnover'].idxmax()]
lowest_turnover = merged_df.loc[merged_df['InventoryTurnover'].idxmin()]

# Display the highest and lowest turnover products
show_to_user(highest_turnover)
show_to_user(lowest_turnover)

# Visualization of turnover ratios for comparison
fig = px.bar(merged_df, x='ProductID', y='InventoryTurnover', title='Inventory Turnover Ratios by ProductID')
show_to_user(fig)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Data Retrieval:** 
    - We retrieve the COGS and average inventory for each product using SQL queries and store the results in `cogs_df` and `avg_inventory_df`.

2. **Data Merging and Calculation:**
    - We merge the two dataframes on `ProductID` to get a combined dataframe.
    - We calculate the inventory turnover ratio for each product and create a new column `InventoryTurnover`.

3. **Identifying Extremes:**
    - We determine the products with the highest and lowest inventory turnover ratios using `idxmax()` and `idxmin()` functions.

4. **Visualization:**
    - We use Plotly to visualize the inventory turnover ratios to provide a clear comparison across all products.

5. **Display Results:**
    - We display the results to the user for both the products with the highest and lowest turnover ratios, as well as the visualization for comparison.

Make sure that the `execute_sql_query` and `show_to_user` functions are implemented correctly in your environment to handle SQL query execution and display of results.","The input code deviates from the reference implementation in several key areas: 

1. **Business Definition and SQL Calculations:** The input code uses COGS and joins separately to calculate the turnover, while the reference uses sales revenue and average inventory in a single SQL query to calculate it.

2. **Merging and Final Calculation:** The input code performs separate queries and merges them, whereas the reference directly calculates the turnover ratio within the SQL query.

3. **Visual Comparison:** The input code visualizes all products' turnover ratios instead of just the highest and lowest, which deviates from the specific requirement. 

Overall, the approach and results visualization differ significantly, leading to different outputs compared to the reference implementation.",None

### Explanation:
1. **Retrieving Data**: The SQL query retrieves order counts for each employee.
2. **Identifying Extremes**: We use `iloc` to pick the top (highest) and bottom (lowest) entries from the `df`.
3. **Visualization**: The order counts are visualized in a bar chart using Plotly and displayed.
4. **Data Display**: The results are shown to the user using the `show_to_user` function.

Make sure your `execute_sql_query`, `show_to_user`, and other utility functions are implemented correctly to reflect this code's functionality.","The input code does not fully meet the requirements of the business analytics request due to the following issues: 

1. **SQL Query Logic**: The input query retrieves order counts for all employees but does not specifically query for the ones with the highest and lowest order counts like the reference code. The reference code uses `UNION` to directly fetch employees with the highest and lowest counts.

2. **Employee Details**: The input code does not retrieve FirstName or LastName, so the visualizations and display do not include full employee identification beyond EmployeeID, unlike the reference.

3. **Displaying Extremes**: While the input code does show employees with the highest and lowest order counts, it does not ensure these are properly identified in the visualization where they matter (i.e., the `show_to_user` for extremes should be before the entire visualization for clarity, and ideally highlight these over others in the visual representation).

Thus, the input implementation diverges from the business logic of emphasizing highest and lowest order counts specifically, alongside missing full employee details.",None

- **Visualization**: The Plotly library's `px.bar` function is used to create a bar chart showing each employee's revenue contribution. The x-axis uses the `FirstName` of the employees, and the y-axis represents the `EmployeeRevenue`.

- **Display the Result**: The resulting figure is displayed to the user using `show_to_user`. 

Make sure to adjust the `x` parameter in `px.bar` to include the right column for identifying employees if needed.","The input Python code does not correctly calculate the total revenue as it does not account for the discount in the calculation, unlike the reference implementation. The reference code multiplies 'UnitPrice', 'Quantity', and '(1 - Discount)' to derive 'TotalRevenue', which accurately represents the revenue per employee with discount applied. The 'x' parameter in the Plotly bar chart is also mismatched, using 'FirstName' instead of 'EmployeeID', which can cause issues if there are duplicate first names.",Base

It includes a SQL query to aggregate order counts by month, a visualization of order counts by month using Plotly, and additionally identifies the month with the highest order count. The key logic steps are consistent with the reference code, such as executing a similar SQL query and visualizing the results correctly.","To identify which month has the highest number of orders historically and visualize the order count by month, we can use the SQL query provided to get the data and then create a visualization using Python. We'll utilize libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualization.

Here's how you can implement this using the `execute_sql_query` method to execute the SQL query and `plot_data` method to visualize it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# SQL query to retrieve order counts by month

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m') AS OrderMonth, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM orders
GROUP BY OrderMonth

df['OrderMonth'] = pd.to_datetime(df['OrderMonth'])

# Visualize the order count by month
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.bar(df['OrderMonth'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m'), df['OrderCount'], color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Order Count')
plt.title('Order Count by Month')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plot_data(plt)

# Identify the month with the highest number of orders
max_order_month = df.loc[df['OrderCount'].idxmax()]
show_data(max_order_month)
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: We use a SQL query to get the order counts by month.
2. **Data Retrieval**: The `execute_sql_query` function retrieves the data.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - We create a bar chart using `matplotlib` to visualize the order counts for each month.
4. **Identifying the Max Month**: We determine the month with the highest order count.
5. **Function Calls**:
   - Use `plot_data` to show the bar chart.
   - Use `show_data` to display the month with the highest order count. 

Make sure the libraries used (like `matplotlib`) are included in your environment. Adjust the plotting and data display methods as per the specific functions available in your analysis toolkit.","The input code correctly follows the business analytics request of identifying the month with the highest number of orders and visualizing the order count by month. The SQL query groups by month and counts orders similarly to the reference implementation. The visualization using `matplotlib` achieves the same goal as the `plotly` visualization in the reference. The input code also correctly identifies and displays the month with the highest order count, adhering to the logic and requirements outlined in the reference implementation.",both

3. **Highest Orders Calculation**: The month with the highest number of orders is found using `idxmax()`.
4. **Data Display**: The result is displayed using `show_to_user`.
5. **Visualization**: A bar chart is created with Plotly and displayed to compare monthly order volumes.","The input code is incorrect because the SQL query does not sort the results by month, potentially leading to unordered visualization.

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- We are joining the `orders`, `[Order Details]`, and `products` tables to get the relevant data.
- We filter the orders for the specified date range (April 2023).
- We calculate the average lead time using `AVG(DATEDIFF(orders.ShippedDate, orders.OrderDate))`.
- We group the result by `products.SupplierID` and order it by `supplier_lead_time` ascending to find the shortest average.
- Finally, we limit the result to 1 to get the top supplier with the shortest lead time.

### Displaying the Result:
The result is displayed as a dictionary for clear understanding, which shows the SupplierID and the calculated average lead time.","The input Python code correctly mirrors the logic of the reference implementation. It executes the same SQL query to find the supplier with the shortest average lead time in April 2023. Both implementations filter orders by date, join the necessary tables, calculate the average lead time, group by SupplierID, order by the lead time in ascending order, and limit the result to find the top supplier with the shortest lead time. The difference in converting the result DataFrame to a dictionary for display does not affect the correctness of the query or the fulfillment of the business analytics request.",Finetuned

The reference code uses a bar chart instead, emphasizing individual region comparison rather than a map format.","To fulfill the user's request for listing customers with their respective regions and the count of orders placed, and visualize the order counts geographically, we can use Python along with libraries such as pandas and plotly.

Here is the Python code that implements the requirement:

show_to_user(fig)
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **SQL Query***: We retrieve data concerning customer IDs, regions, and the number of orders by executing the defined SQL query with `execute_sql_query`.

2. **Data Visualization**: We use Plotly's `px.choropleth` function for data visualization. However, we need to ensure that regions can be represented correctly. The example assumes that the locations key matches a geographical representation.

3. **Display the Visualization**: Finally, the plot is shown to the user using the `show_to_user` function.

### Note
To accurately map regions to a visualization, `locations` should correspond to actual geographical data, such as region ISO codes for choropleth maps. Adjust this depending on the data available using the correct parameters for identifying geographic locations. If regions do not correspond to standard codes, consider using plot types that can visualize your dataframe more directly, such as barcharts, and adjust the visualization method as needed.","The input Python code does not adhere to the requirement because it attempts to visualize data at the customer level using `px.choropleth`, which requires geographic identifiers. The reference code aggregates at the region level and uses `px.bar` to create a bar chart of total orders per region, correctly fulfilling the requirement.",None

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query fetches data including `SupplierID`, `CompanyName`, `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and the total quantity sold per product, grouped appropriately.
  
2. **Data Execution**: The `execute_sql_query()` function retrieves the data and stores it in a pandas dataframe called `data`.

3. **Visualization**: A stacked bar chart is created using Plotly's `px.bar()`. The visualization uses `SupplierID` on the x-axis and `TotalSold` on the y-axis, and stacks the bars by `ProductName`.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: Fetch the data for `OrderID`, `OrderDate`, and `ShippedDate`.
2. **Convert to Datetime**: Ensure the date columns are in datetime format.
3. **Calculate Days Between**: Compute the difference in days between `OrderDate` and `ShippedDate`.
4. **Percentage Calculation**: Find the percentage of orders shipped within 5 days.
5. **Display**: Show the result to the user in a clearly structured format.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query retrieves the `ProductID` and total quantity sold for each product during March 2023 by joining the `Order Details` and `orders` tables. It groups the results by `ProductID`, orders them in descending order based on `TotalQuantity`, and limits the output to the top result.
  
2. **Data Retrieval**: The `execute_sql_query` function runs the SQL query and returns a pandas DataFrame.

3. **Display Result**: The code checks if the DataFrame is not empty and then displays the top result using `show_to_user`. If there are no results, it displays an empty DataFrame.

### Notes on the Code:
- `execute_sql_query`: A function to run the SQL query and retrieve data into a pandas dataframe.
- `pd.to_datetime`: Ensures the 'Month' column is in datetime format for proper plotting.
- `px.line`: Utilizes Plotly for a dynamic and interactive line plot. Each product's trend will be represented in a different color.
- `show_to_user`: Displays the result, which is a visualization of the monthly sales trends. 

This code provides an excellent way to visually inspect how sales trends for each product have shifted over the past year.","The input code correctly replicates the logic of the reference implementation. Both scripts fetch the monthly sales data for each product over the last year using an SQL query and result in a dataframe. Additionally, they use Plotly to create a line plot of the sales trend.

### Explanation
1. **SQL Query**: A SQL query is defined to get the number of orders per month by grouping the `OrderDate`.
2. **Data Execution**: The `execute_sql_query` function is used to run the SQL query and store the results in a DataFrame.
3. **Visualization**: The `plotly.express.line` function creates a line plot of the monthly order counts.
4. **Displaying Results**: Finally, the plot is displayed to the user using the `show_to_user` function. 

Make sure you have the necessary plotly library installed and configured to display the visualization.","The input code uses a line plot instead of a bar chart, which makes the visualization inconsistent with the reference implementation. The prompt specifies that the reference logic is correct if it answers the business analytics request and adheres to the referenced logic. Both codes correctly accomplish the task of counting orders per month. However, the reference implementation specifies a bar chart for visualization. Therefore, the visual representation differs, impacting its correctness against the reference logic.",Base

# Show the plot to the user
show_to_user(fig)
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query selects the `Freight` column and calculates the fulfillment time by subtracting `OrderDate` from `ShippedDate`.
2. **Data Retrieval**: The `execute_sql_query` function runs the SQL query and returns a DataFrame containing the data.
3. **Plot Creation**: We use `plotly.express.scatter` to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship.
4. **Visualization**: Finally, `show_to_user` displays the plot to the user in an interactive window.

Make sure that `execute_sql_query` and `show_to_user` are correctly defined to interact with the MDDX data warehouse and display visualizations properly.","The input Python code correctly follows the logic of the reference implementation. It executes an SQL query to retrieve 'Freight' and calculated 'FulfillmentTime' from the 'orders' table.

### How It Works:
1. **SQL Query Execution**: The code executes the SQL query using `execute_sql_query`, which retrieves data in a pandas DataFrame format.
2. **Bar Chart Creation**: It uses `plotly.express.bar` to create a bar chart where `CustomerID` is on the x-axis and `order_count` is on the y-axis.
3. **Display the Chart**: Finally, it utilizes `show_to_user` to render the figure to the user. 

### Note:

### Explanation:

2. **Execute SQL Query**: The query is executed to get the relevant orders.
3. **Count Unique Orders**: We compute the number of unique `OrderID` values that meet the condition.
4. **Display Result**: Finally, the result is displayed using the provided utility function.

This matches the logic of the reference implementation, which also retrieves the earliest hire date.","To find the hire date of the oldest employee, you would typically query the employee database to retrieve the birth date of the oldest employee and their corresponding hire date. You can use SQL for the query and Python to execute and retrieve the data. 

Here’s how you could implement this using Python with the given SQL structure:

```python
import pandas as pd

# SQL query to retrieve the hire date of the oldest employee
sql_query = """"""
SELECT e.HireDate
FROM employees e
ORDER BY e.BirthDate ASC
LIMIT 1;
""""""

# Execute the SQL query

    oldest_hire_date = df.iloc[0]['HireDate']
    show_to_user(oldest_hire_date)
else:
    show_to_user(""No data found."")
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query selects the `HireDate` from the `employees` table and orders the results by `BirthDate` in ascending order to ensure that the oldest employee is chosen.
2. **Execution**: The query is executed using the `execute_sql_query` function, which returns a DataFrame.
3. **Result Extraction**: Check if the DataFrame is not empty before accessing the first row. Extract the hire date of the oldest employee.
4. **Display Result**: Use the `show_to_user` function to display the result to the user. If no data is found, notify the user accordingly.

Make sure to adjust any specifics based on actual function definitions (like `execute_sql_query` and `show_to_user`) or column types that might need conversion for display.","The input code orders by 'BirthDate' to find the oldest employee, then retrieves the 'HireDate'. However, the reference implementation orders by 'HireDate'. The request is to find the hire date of the oldest employee (considered by company tenure), not by birth date. Therefore, the logic differs from the reference, which directly finds the earliest 'HireDate'.",Base

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query retrieves the `ProductID` and the total sales quantity for each product for the first quarter of 2023.
2. **DataFrame Creation**: The result of the SQL query is loaded into a DataFrame.
3. **Visualization**: A bar chart is created using Plotly to visualize the sales performance of each product.
4. **Display to User**: The visualization is displayed using the `show_to_user` function.

Before running the code, ensure that the `execute_sql_query` and `show_to_user` functions are correctly implemented to match the requirements of your company's data handling utilities.","The input Python code is logically equivalent to the reference implementation. Both codes execute an SQL query to retrieve the sales quantities for each product in Q1 2023 and then visualize the results using a bar chart.

The visualization part is handled similarly with Plotly Express, and the displayed title and axes are appropriate and match the intent of the request.

### Code Explanation
1. **SQL Query:** The provided SQL query counts distinct Product IDs from the `products` table where there is at least one entry in the `Order Details` that has a discount greater than zero.
2. **Data Retrieval:** The `execute_query` function runs the SQL query and returns a DataFrame containing the count result.
3. **Data Extraction:** The count of products with discounts is extracted from the resulting DataFrame to be displayed.
4. **Display Result:** A new DataFrame is created with the count for better clarity, and this result is sent to the user using `show_to_user`. 

By directly executing the SQL query which aggregates the result, we ensure efficiency and correctness in the presentation of the data.","The input code correctly counts distinct ProductIDs where the discount is greater than zero, similar to the reference implementation.

The primary difference is the usage of 'DATEDIFF' function arguments order in SQL, which is equivalent irrespective of which dates are subtracted, and the input code uses Plotly to visualize the results instead of just displaying them. Therefore, the input code adheres to the business analytics request successfully.","To calculate the average order fulfillment time per employee, you can follow the SQL approach to get the necessary data and then use Python's `pandas` library to compute the average fulfillment time. 

Here's how you can do that in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# SQL Query to get order fulfillment times
sql_query = """"""
SELECT e.EmployeeID, 
       DATEDIFF(o.ShippedDate, o.OrderDate) AS OrderFulfillmentTime 
FROM employees e 
JOIN orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID;
""""""

# Execute the SQL query
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)

# Calculate the average order fulfillment time per employee
avg_fulfillment_time = df.groupby('EmployeeID', as_index=False).agg({'OrderFulfillmentTime': 'mean'})

# Show the result to the user
show_to_user(avg_fulfillment_time)
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query retrieves the `EmployeeID` along with the order fulfillment time for each employee.
2. **DataFrame Manipulation**: The resulting DataFrame is grouped by `EmployeeID`, and the mean fulfillment time is calculated for each employee.
3. **Displaying the Result**: The result is displayed to the user using the `show_to_user` utility function.","The input Python code correctly calculates the average order fulfillment time per employee using a similar logic to the reference implementation. Both the reference and input implementations execute a SQL query to retrieve order fulfillment times by EmployeeID. They then calculate the average fulfillment time and display the result using the 'show_to_user' function. The main difference between the two is the initial SQL string and the calculation method, but these differences do not affect the correctness of the business logic.",both

### Explanation:

1. **SQL Query**: The SQL query selects `ShipVia` and calculates the average fulfillment time using `DATEDIFF(ShippedDate, OrderDate)` for each shipping method.
   
2. **Data Retrieval**: The query is executed using `execute_sql_query`, which returns a DataFrame.

3. **Data Visualization**: Utilizing Plotly's `px.bar`, we create a bar chart to visualize the average fulfillment time for each shipping method;

4. **Display**: Finally, the visualization is shown to the user.

```","The input code calculates 'TotalSales' using discounted prices, whereas the reference code computes 'MonthlySales' based on quantity. The metric and logic are different. Additionally, the input code uses 'OrderMonth' for grouping, offering monthly granularity using 'DATE_TRUNC', different from the reference implementation using MONTH extraction, potentially leading to variances depending on the SQL engine.","To find the monthly sales performance for each product and visualize it, we'll follow these steps:

1. Connect to the database and execute the SQL query to get the sales data.
2. Process this data to ensure it is suitable for visualization.
3. Use a plotting library to visualize the monthly sales trends.

Here's a sample Python code to accomplish that:

```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# SQL query to retrieve monthly sales performance for each product
sql_query = """"""
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, 
       SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity,
       DATE_FORMAT(od.OrderDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month 
FROM products p 
JOIN `Order Details` od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID 
GROUP BY p.ProductID, Month;
""""""

# Execute the SQL query
sales_data = execute_sql_query(sql_query)

# Convert 'Month' to datetime for better handling
sales_data['Month'] = pd.to_datetime(sales_data['Month'], format='%Y-%m')

# Visualize the sales trends
fig = px.line(sales_data, x='Month', y='TotalQuantity', color='ProductName', 
              title='Monthly Sales Performance for Each Product')

# Show the result to the user
show_to_user(fig)
```

### Key Assumptions:
- The `execute_sql_query` and `show_to_user` functions are defined elsewhere in your utility code.
- Plotly is used for visualization and assumes it's installed in the Python environment.
- The SQL query correctly aggregates the total quantity sold per product per month.

### Potential Enhancements:
- Allow interaction in the visualization, like filtering by product.
- Add error handling for database connection and query execution.","The input Python code deviates from the reference implementation in several aspects: 

1. **SQL Query Differences:**
   - The input code groups by `Month` using `DATE_FORMAT` on `OrderDate` from the `Order Details` table. This differs from extracting the month directly in the reference which uses PostgreSQL's EXTRACT function. This causes a mismatch since it assumes `OrderDate` belongs to `Order Details` instead of `orders`.
   - The input code omits joining with the `orders` table.
   - The SQL query in the input does not select the columns in the order expected by the reference implementation.

2. **Month Handling:**
   - In the input code, `Month` is converted to datetime format, which can lead to a different axis order and format in the visualization compared to treating it as an integer month.

3. **SQL Grouping Consistency:**
   - The input code groups by `ProductID` and `Month` without including `ProductName` in the GROUP BY clause, which may lead to issues if SQL syntax requires it.

Overall, the discrepancies in SQL logic and data handling affect consistency with the reference implementation.",None

Both codes filter orders from the previous month using the month and year conditions, even though the exact SQL syntax differs. The reference code uses 'MONTH' and 'YEAR' functions, whereas the input uses 'DATE_TRUNC' and date arithmetic, which also correctly identifies the last month. Finally, both codes use 'execute_sql_query' to execute their respective SQL queries and display the result using 'show_to_user'.","```python

Additionally, the code includes a label for the y-axis in the bar chart, which is an enhancement rather than a deviation from the reference logic.","To visualize which employees have handled the most orders and compare the number of orders for each employee, we can use the following Python code.

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query Execution**: The SQL query is constructed to count the number of orders handled by each employee and sort it in descending order.
2. **Data Visualization**: The `plotly.express` library is used to create a bar chart, which is suitable for comparing the number of orders handled by each employee.
3. **Display**: The generated figure is displayed to the user.

This code provides a clear visual representation of the order handling performance of each employee.","The input Python code closely matches the reference implementation and correctly answers the business analytics request. It executes a similar SQL query to count and order the number of orders handled by each employee. The resulting data is visualized using a bar chart with 'plotly.express', and the visualization is displayed to the user. The difference in the alias name for the SQL result is inconsequential, and additional labeling in the bar chart is meant to enhance clarity. Overall, the logic and purpose align perfectly with the reference code.",both
