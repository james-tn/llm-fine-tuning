        "review_note": "The original Python code correctly executes the SQL query and creates a line chart visualizing the on-time orders. However, one potential issue is ensuring the 'Month' column is in datetime format for accurate plotting in Plotly. The correction ensures that 'Month' is converted to a datetime object if it is not already. Plotly generally handles this conversion automatically, but explicitly converting it is a good practice for data integrity and ensuring compatibility across various environments.",
