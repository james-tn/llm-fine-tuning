# LLM Fine-Tuning: Examples and Best Practices  
  
This repository contains examples and best practices for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using both **open-source models** and **OpenAI models**. Whether you're working with open-source models or leveraging OpenAI's APIs, this repo provides hands-on guides and resources for various fine-tuning scenarios.  
  
## Repository Structure  
  
### 1. [Open Source LLMs](opensource_llm)  
Fine-tuning large open-source language models has its unique challenges, including infrastructure setup, high computational demands, and scalable training processes. This section is based on a blog series that explores:  
  
- Fundamentals of scaling fine-tuning for large open-source LLMs using **Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML)**.  
- Real-world pipeline setups for **end-to-end model training**, **hyperparameter optimization**, and **testing**.  
- Deployment of trained models for practical use.  
- Advanced techniques for handling multi-billion-parameter models efficiently.  
  
For a detailed explanation, see the [Open Source LLM Blog Post Series](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/machinelearningblog/scaling-open-source-llm-fine-tuning-with-azure-ml/4362787).  
  
### 2. [OpenAI Models](azureopenai)  
This section provides examples and best practices for fine-tuning OpenAI models for various scenarios, enabling you to adapt models to your specific use case. It includes:  
  
- **Function Calling**: Fine-tuning for tasks that require structured outputs or API integrations.  
- **Python Analytic**: Adapting models for advanced analytics and Python-based tasks.  
- **SQL Generation**: Training models to generate SQL queries from natural language inputs.
